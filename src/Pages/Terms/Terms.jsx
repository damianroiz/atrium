        This is particularly the case when information is collected to
        investigate a breach of contractual or legal obligations, to detect
        fraud or crime or to enforce a law, and that in such case obtaining your
        consent could be detrimental to the objective for which the information
        was collected.
      </p>

      <p>
        We limit the collection of your personal information to information

        it from third parties or as otherwise permitted by law. We may not
        disclose your personal information to anyone without your consent,
        except as may be required by law.

        maintenance and other services to us. These third parties may have
        access to or process personal information as part of the services they
        provide to us. We limit the information we provide to these service
        providers to only that information that is reasonably necessary to
        enable them to perform their functions, and our contracts with these
        service providers require them to safeguard confidentiality of this
        information and undertakes to respect the legislation concerning the
        protection of personal information.

      <h2>Retention period</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your personal information only for the length of time it is
        needed to fulfil its intended purpose. After this time period, the
        information is destroyed. When we destroy your personal information, we
        take steps to ensure that no unauthorized person can access it during
        the destruction process.
      </p>
      <h2>Security measures</h2>
      <p>
        We have implemented rigorous security measures to ensure that the
        personal information entrusted to us remains confidential and is
        protected from loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying,
        use, or modification. However, no method of transmission over the
        Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. We therefore
        cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit or
        provide to us, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee
        that such information will not be accessed, obtained, disclosed,
