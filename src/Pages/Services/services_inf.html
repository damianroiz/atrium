      <h1>Physiotherapy</h1>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists are highly-educated experts in physical function,
        movement and mobility. They have advanced knowledge of how the human
        body moves and what stops it moving and use specialized hands-on
        treatment to restore, maintain and maximize optimal function and quality
        of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists assists, diagnose and treat physical symptoms and
        limited movement caused by injury, aging, disability, or medical
        condition. They help patients understand what is causing their
        condition, and work with them to restore, maintain and maximize
        movement, flexibility and physical independence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists develop customized treatment plans that help
        patients take back control. They teach patients how to restore, maintain
        and/or maximize movement, reduce pain, and manage any chronic symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists excel in the treatment of many conditions: back
        pain/injury, whiplash, pregnancy-related muscle/joint issues, urinary
        incontinence and vertigo to name a few. They also help patients manage
        symptoms of chronic conditions like arthritis and chronic pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our physiotherapists help patients who may have otherwise tried
        temporary (e.g., prescription drugs) or more invasive methods (e.g.,
        surgery) to manage their condition. They use individualized therapeutic
        exercise, manual therapy and other treatment techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through physiotherapy, many patients are able to recover unrestricted
        movement which promotes the kind of physical independence necessary for
        a normal lifestyle and work. When it comes to assessing and treating
        people with movement problems, the services of a physiotherapist are
        often essential.

      <h2>What Can I Expect During My First Appointment?</h2>
      <p>
        On arrival, you may be asked to fill out paperwork or complete medical
        history forms. Your physiotherapist will then conduct a detailed
        assessment of your problem or condition. This takes about 30-45 minutes
        and normally involves:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Where you are having the problem</li>
        <li>How the problem started</li>
        <li>
          How the problem is affecting your ability to do daily activities
        </li>
        <li>Your past medical history</li>
        <li>Any medications you are taking</li>
        <li>Your physiotherapist may also need to ask additional questions</li>
        <li>depending on your problem or condition.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A detailed physical examination includes:</p>
      <li>Checking your posture</li>
      <li>Examining range of motion</li>
      <li>Testing muscle strength, ligaments, tendons, and nerves</li>
      <p>
        Your physiotherapist may also check your balance, walking or how much
        you can lift or carry. Once the assessment is complete, your
        physiotherapist will explain what is causing the problem and discuss a
        physiotherapy treatment program.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will then be asked to give consent to the treatment program. Before
        giving consent, make sure you fully understand the treatment plan. Ask
        if you need clarification. Your physiotherapist will explain the
        treatment plan in more detail.

      <h1>What is Functional Dry Needling/Intramuscular Stimulation (IMS)?</h1>
      <p>
        Dry Needling is a valuable, effective and efficient adjunct treatment to
        inactivate myofascial trigger points. It is an invasive procedure in
        which a thin solid filament sterile needle is used. Dry Needling
        involves insertion and repetitive manipulation of the needle in the
        myofascial trigger point. The purpose of this technique is to inactivate
        the myofascial trigger points by producing a local twitch response. This
        local twitch response then releases the shortened bands of muscle
        fibers. The result is muscle relaxation and pain relief. Eliciting this
        local twitch response is important for successful deactivation of the
        trigger point. No medication of any kind is injected. Inactivation of
        the trigger points can bring immediate relief of symptoms.
      </p>

      />
      <h2>What is Myofascial Trigger Point?</h2>
      <p>
        A myofascial trigger point is a hyperirritable spot in a muscle which is
        located in a taut (tight) band and is painful to touch. This
        hypersensitive spot or nodule (the “knot”), can give characteristic
        referred pain, referred tenderness and other referred symptoms in areas
        other than where the muscle is located. (Travel and Simons in Myofascial
        Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual). Janet Travell, MD first
        described the existence of trigger points in the 1940's.
      </p>
      <h2>Advantages of Dry Needling</h2>
      <p>
        The advantages of dry needling over other treatments are that we can
        treat parts of the muscle, and deeper layers of muscles, which our hands
        and fingers cannot reach. Also, this method is far superior in achieving
        a local twitch response over other manual techniques. In addition, there
        are no drugs used so we can treat many trigger points during each
        treatment.
      </p>
      <h2>How is this different from Traditional Acupuncture?</h2>
      <p>
        Dry Needling must not be confused with any type of acupuncture. Whereas
        acupuncture is founded on Traditional Chinese Medicine (Dry Needling is
        based on Western anatomical and physiological principles. It is founded
        by scientific concepts and it continues to evolve using the latest
        research.
      </p>
      <h2>Treatment Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Dry Needling is not a stand-alone treatment by itself. It is always done
        in conjunction with other manual and physical therapy treatments, such
        as exercises, postural training, education and other hands on techniques
        like soft tissue work and manipulation. Since full pain free range of
        motion is the ultimate goal of myofascial treatments, we teach the
        muscles the right away to work in their newly-gained pain free range to
        restore their normal function. It is important that you are an active
        participant in your own treatments and well being. Therefore you must
        follow through with your home exercise program which we will establish
        specifically for you.
      </p>
      <h2>Treatment Frequency</h2>
      <p>
        Typically, we will use Dry Needling once a week to inactivate the
        trigger points and you will have one or two more treatments that week to
        work on other aspects of your condition. There is no specific,
        predetermined number of treatments for patients with myofascial pain.
        Chronic conditions will require more treatments than acute conditions.
        In addition, the amount of treatments will also depend on concurrent
        other medical conditions, your compliance with the exercises, your age
        and physical condition.
      </p>
      <h2>Side Effects & Risks</h2>
      <p>
        The commonest side effects of FDN include temporary increase in pain
        which can last from a couple of hours to several days, followed by an
        expected improvement in the overall pain state. This increase in pain is
        mainly caused by the “twitching” of the muscles. It is also related to
        over activity of the shortened muscle bands that have not been released,
        or sometimes there is a temporarily increased spasm of the treated
        muscles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most serious risk with FDN is accidental puncture of a lung
        (pneumothorax). This can only happen if the needle is placed too closed
        to the chest/lung fields. If this were to occur, it may likely require a
        chest x-ray and no further treatment. The symptoms of shortness of
        breath may last for several days to weeks. A more severe puncture can
        require hospitalization and re-inflation of the lung. This is a rare
        complication, and in skilled hands it should not be a major concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other less serious risks include infection and bruising: Any time a
        needle is used there is a risk of infection. However, your practitioner
        uses new, disposable and sterile needles, and is trained to the highest
        level of aseptic skin preparation and needle insertion technique.
        Therefore, infections are extremely rare. Injury to a blood vessel
        causing a bruise, and/or nerve injury may also occur. Bruising is a
        common occurrence and should not be a concern.

      <h1>Acupuncture</h1>
      <p>
        Acupuncture is an ancient form of Chinese medicine involving the
        insertion of ultra-fine needles into specific points of the skin. These
        points of energy are located along 14 meridians, or channels, that cover
        the entire body. Using modern techniques, contemporary medical
        acupuncture is able to precisely stimulate nerves to modulate pain and

Graston Technique
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
-->

    <div class="graston">
      <h1>Graston Technique</h1>
      <p>
        Graston technique is a form of instrument-assisted or augmented soft
        tissue mobilization (ASTM) that enables practitioners to improve scar
        tissue, fascial restrictions and range of motion. The theory behind this
        IASTM technique is that by using a tool to introduce microtrauma into an
        area of excessive scarring and/or soft tissue fibrosis, an inflammatory
        response will occur. In a 2017 Journal of Exercise Rehabilitation study,
        the authors describe that “Such inflammation restarts the healing
        process by removing the scar tissue and releasing adhesions, while also
        increasing blood and nutrient supply to the injured area and migration
        of fibroblasts.” (1b)
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of tools helps to get to the root of the problem, but it’s also
        intended to reduce stress on the therapist’s hands. Graston technique
        allows a practitioner to get deep into the problematic tissue yet be
        sensitive to a patient’s level of pain tolerance. As the instruments are
        moved over the affected area and come in contact with adhesions, they
        help to break up scar tissue dysfunction and restrictions of the fascia.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://www.atriumphysiotherapy.com/images/Graston.jpg"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        In time, this process can reduce or eliminate the adhered fibers,
        restoring range of motion and eliminating the associated pain. The aim
        and ideal outcome of Graston technique is to help transform your soft
        tissue injury into healthy functioning tissue once again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why does Graston technique aim to reduce scar tissue? Scar tissue is
        thick, dense tissue that appears after injury or trauma. It can limit
        your range of motion, cause pain and lead to dysfunctional movement.
        Graston technique aims to break up this scar tissue to interrupt and
        break the cycle of pain and dysfunction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Graston technique is never used completely on its own. The full
        treatment includes brief warm-up exercises, Graston technique treatment,
        followed by stretching and strengthening activities. Ice can also be a
        part of the follow-up portion of treatment if subacute inflammation
        (inflammation that lasts longer than acute inflammation but is not
        chronic) is present.
      </p>
      <p>
        This noninvasive method of healing known as Graston technique or
        instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) is used to treat
        all kinds soft tissue conditions, whether they are chronic, acute or
        post-surgical. You may have never heard of Graston technique before, but
        other people have, like the 431 professional and amateur sports
        organizations currently utilizing Graston technique on a regular basis.
        (1a) Clearly, some of the most physically active and frequently injured
        people on the planet must be feeling the relief of this healing
        technique!
      </p>
      <p>Graston® technique can be used to treat:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis)</li>

Triton Spinal Decompression

    <div class="spinal-decom">
      <h1>Triton Spinal Decompression</h1>
      <!--change original image for something more appealing-->
      <p>
        Spinal Decompression is a non-surgical and drug-free answer for disc
        related problems of the lumbar or cervical spine. Many people across the
        country and around the world have found relief from the pain associated
        with herniated discs, bulging discs, facet syndrome, degenerative joint
        disease, pinched nerves, and other spinal afflictions from decompression
        therapy. Spinal Disc Decompression uses computer-aided technology to
        apply gentle, non-surgical decompression to your spine which increases
        circulation into the spinal discs and joints, thus helping to relieve
        the symptoms that cause pain and dysfunction.
      </p>
      <h2>How does Spinal Decompression work?</h2>
      <img
        src="https://www.atriumphysiotherapy.com/images/spinalBefore.png"
        alt=""
      />
      <h3>The pumping action of the table does two things:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          As the table pulls on your spine it slowly stretches your spine and
          increases the space between the two spinal bones (the disc space).
          This creates a negative pressure or vacuum in the disc which helps to
          suck the disc back inwards and away from the nerve that is being
          pinched. Although the amount is very small each treatment, with
          consecutive treatments it creates more space for the nerve and
          decreases the size of the disc herniation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secondly, the pumping action of the table sucks nutrients in and
          pushes nutrients out creating a nutrient exchange (imbibition). The
          increased level of nutrients in the disc allows the disc to have the
          nutrition it needs to speed up the healing process. Because discs
          don't have a large blood supply they do not get a lot of nutrients on
          their own. This is why most people don't just get better on their own,
          we typically cause as much damage to our discs in a day as we can heal
          with the natural imbibition. With spinal decompression we greatly
          increase the nutrients to the disc which provides the building blocks
          necessary for discs to heal more rapidly. Studies have shown that the
          disc space can increase 1-3mm over the treatment cycle that is
          provided. Although that seems a small amount it can have a large
          influence on the space needed to get pressure off of the sensitive
          nerves in the area.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Research on the effectiveness of Spinal Decompression:</h2>
      <p>
        A recent clinical study of 219 patients has shown that spinal
        decompression therapy provided a resolution of symptoms for 86% of the
        participants who completed their therapy, while 84% remained pain-free
        90 days post-treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several tables that perform non-surgical decompression of the
        spine. The following results were obtained from DRS/Inter-Discal
        Decompression (IDD) therapy, Vertebral-Axial Decompression and
        non-surgical Spinal Decompression Therapy. Although the concept of
        non-surgical Spinal Decompression therapy is similar in the DRS/VAX-D,
        please note that each table is a registered trademark and the following
        research may be specific to a specific decompression table/protocol
        employed.

      />
      <h2>Clinical Trials</h2>
      <p>
        In a recent journal article in Orthopedic Technology Review titled
        Surgical Alternatives: Spinal Decompression, results showed that 86% of
        the 219 patients who completed the therapy reported resolution of
        symptoms while 84% of patients remained pain free 90 days post
        treatment. Physical examination findings showed improvement in 92% of
        the 219 patients, and remained intact in 89% of these patients 90 days
        after treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another article in Journal of Neurological Research reported that
        vertebral axial [spinal] decompression was successful in 71% of the 778
        cases". The success rate varied from 73% for patients with a single
        herniated disc. It was 72% for people with multiple herniated discs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The American Journal of Pain Management reported "good to excellent"
        relief in 86% of patients with herniated discs, with back pain and
        sciatica symptoms being relieved. Good to excellent results were also
        obtained in 75% of those with facet syndrome.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small non-randomized study in Anesthesiology News reported of the 23
        patients who responded to therapy, 52% had a pain level of zero, 91%
        were able to resume their normal daily activities, and 87% were either
        working or were retired without having back pain as the cause of
        retirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a small study to determine the long-term effects of vertebral axial
        decompression, the following results were obtained: "Among 23 patients,
        71% showed more than 50% reduction in pain immediately after treatment,
        and 86% showed a 50% or better pain reduction at four years. After four
        years, 52% of respondents reported a pain level of zero. Thus, pain
        relief not only improved but lasted. This pilot study shows great
        promise for long term relief and new pain management techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interesting study at the Rio Grande Hospital, Department of
        Neurosurgery compared the effects of 20 treatment sessions vs. 10
        treatment sessions on chronic low back pain sufferers. The group
        receiving 20 treatments of decompression therapy reported a 76.5% with
        complete remission and 19.6% with partial remission of pain and
        disability. The second group, receiving 10 treatments of decompression
        therapy, reported a 42.9% rate of remission and 24.1% with partial
        remission. Failure rate was only 3.9% for those receiving 20 treatment
        sessions while it was 32.9% for those receiving only 10 sessions.
        Remission was defined as 90% or greater relief of pain, back to work
        without limitations, and abilities to carry out Activities of Daily
        Living (ADL's). Partial remission was defined as persistence of some
        pain but ability to carry out most ADL's and return to work with some
        restriction of duties, depending on the occupation. Failure rate was
        defined as no change in the level of pain and or/ADL.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see from the above referenced Clinical Trials, Spinal
        Decompression Therapy is an effective therapy for people experiencing
        Discogenic or Arthritic pain (pain arising from the disc or caused by
        various types of Spinal Arthritis). In addition, promising research
        suggests that the effects of Spinal Decompression Therapy can be a
        long-lasting solution to certain chronic back pain disorders. Although
        failure rates are relatively low, studies suggest that completion of
        prescribed treatments can reduce failure rates from 32.9% to 3.9%.

      <p>
        Laser Therapy uses red and infrared light for the relief of pain, to
        accelerate healing and decrease inflammation. When the light source is
        placed against the skin, the photons penetrate several centimeters and
        get absorbed by the mitochondria, the energy producing part of a cell.
        This energy fuels many positive physiological responses resulting in the
        restoration of normal cell morphology and function. Laser Therapy has
        been successfully used to treat a broad range of medical conditions,
        including musculoskeletal problems, arthritis, sports injuries,
        post-surgical wounds, diabetic ulcers and dermatological conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike many pharmacological treatments that mask pain or only address
        the symptoms of disease, Laser Therapy treats the underlying condition
        or pathology to promote healing. This means that the treatments are
        effective and the benefits of Laser Therapy are long lasting.

      />
      <h1>K-Tape</h1>
      <p>
        KT Tape® is applied along muscles, ligaments, and tendons (soft tissue)
        to provide a lightweight, external support that helps you remain active
        while recovering from injuries.*
      </p>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        When an area of the body is injured through impact or over-use, the
        lymphatic fluid builds up causing inflammation and swelling. This
        accumulation of lymphatic fluids may cause increased pressure on muscles
        and tissue which can cause significant discomfort or pain*.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is believed that when applied correctly, KT Tape lifts the skin,
        decompressing the layers of fascia, allowing for greater movement of
        lymphatic fluid which transports white blood cells throughout the body
        and removes waste products, cellular debris, and bacteria.

      <h1>Massage Therapy</h1>
      <p>
        Massage Therapy involves gentle hands-on manipulation of the soft
        tissues of your body. Therapeutic massage focuses on your muscles,
        connective tissue, tendons, ligaments and joints. Atrium Physiotherapy
        Registered Massage Therapists manipulate your muscles and other soft
        tissues of the body with varying degrees of pressure and movement. This
        helps to relieve pain and tension. If done soon enough after accidents
        involving trauma and injury, massage can greatly reduce the development
        of painful muscular patterning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Massage Therapy is more than a period of relaxation, the therapeutic
        message helps diminish physical problems caused by stress, back pain,
        loss of energy, insomnia, etc. Massage can bring physical, mental and
        emotional changes. The benefits can vary from individual to individual.

      <p>
        Combining hot stone protocols with a full body massage provides a very
        healing and effective experience. The hot stones also expand blood
        vessels, which encourages blood flow throughout the body. The hot stones
        have a sedative effect that can relieve chronic pain, reduce stress and
        promote deep relaxation.

      <p>
        A hot stone massage is a type of massage therapy. It’s used to help you
        relax and ease tense muscles and damaged soft tissues throughout your
        body.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a hot stone massage, smooth, flat, heated stones are placed on
        specific parts of your body. The stones are usually made of basalt, a
        type of volcanic rock that retains heat. According to the University of
        New Hampshire Health Services, hot massage stones are heated to between
        130 and 145 degrees.

        weight-bearing activities like walking, running and standing. Ideally,
        it should provide full, custom and corrected arch contact so that the
        foot works in a biomechanically correct way. At Atrium Physiotherapy we

      <h1>MVA (Motor Vehicle Accident)</h1>
      <p>
        A personal injury from auto accident trauma is common, but sometimes
        severe. An injury caused by Motor Vehicle Accident may result in lost
        work time, and cause difficulties in dealing with day-to-day
        responsibilities. After you've been injured in a crash, it's vital to
        get physiotherapy as quickly as possible. Many times, the effects of an
        auto injury are delayed or subtle. Seek medical advice as quickly as
        possible to ensure you are adequately treated and protected for the
        future.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is easy to sustain neck trauma is when one car collides into another.
        The passenger in the automobile has their neck jerked back quickly
        resulting in an injury we know as whiplash.
      </p>
      <img src="https://atriumphysiotherapy.com/images/whiplash.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Whiplash can include: strained muscles and/or ligaments. This kind of
        neck injury is often associated with tension type headaches and head
        pain as a result of cervical dysfunction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other symptoms of whiplash include: nausea, arm and shoulder pain, and
        tingling in the hands and fingers. After you've been injured in a crash,
        it's vital to get physiotherapy evaluation as quickly as possible. Many
        times, the effects of an auto injury are delayed or subtle. Seek medical
        advice as quickly as possible to rule out any serious injury, and to
        ensure you are adequately treated.

Active Release Technique

    <div class="art">
      <h1>Active Release Technique (ART)</h1>
      <img src="" alt="Active Release Technique" />
      <p>
        Active release technique (ART) treats your body’s soft tissue by
        combining manipulation and movement. The technique’s been around for
        more than 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        ART entails identifying, isolating, and targeting the affected area to
        break up scar tissue. This promotes blood flow and faster healing of
        injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was first used by Dr. P. Michael Leahy, a chiropractor, to treat soft
        tissue disorders in elite athletes and has since been used to treat
        millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
        ART can be used to treat pain and other symptoms caused by injury or
        damage to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>Fascia:</span>This is fibrous connective tissue that protects
          and supports muscles and organs throughout your body. Inflammation
          across a band of fascia tissue can cause extreme pain and stiffness.
          Plantar fasciitis is a common fascia tissue condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Major muscle groups:</span>Strains and pulls from overuse or
          trauma can affect any of your major muscle groups. This includes
          muscles in your neck and shoulders, back, and hamstrings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Tendons and ligaments.</span> Tendons connect muscles to bone
          and ligaments connect bone to bone. Injury to either can cause pain
          and decrease range of motion.
        </li>
      </ul>

Vestibular Rehabilitations

    <div class="vestibular-rehab">
      <h1>Vestibular Rehabilitations</h1>
      <p>
        Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), an inner ear problem, is
        the most common cause of vertigo. We can normally correct the condition
        in 1-3 treatments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vestibular rehabilitation is a proven treatment for dizziness and
        balance problems and is highly effective for all age groups.
      </p>

      <p>
        The vestibular system includes the parts of your inner ear that sense
        your head position and movement, the nerve pathways that carry that
        information to your brain, and the parts of the brain that process it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The brain uses inputs from the vestibular system, visual system and your
        muscles and joints to maintain your balance, orientation, and the
        ability to see clearly when you move.
      </p>
      <p>Causes and symptoms of dizziness and balance issues:</p>

      <p>
        Vestibular issues can result from a variety of problems, including inner
        ear issues and infections, jaw injuries, neck or head trauma, infection,
        inflammation and certain brain-related issues, and diseases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Problems in any part of this complex system can result in dizziness,
        vertigo, unsteadiness and visual issues and associated nausea, vomiting,
        headaches, fatigue and poor concentration.
      </p>

      <h2>How does vestibular rehabilitation work?</h2>

      <p>
        Vestibular rehabilitation is a research-based therapy that is proven to
        be effective for many different dizziness and balance conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will help you learn about your condition and develop a customized
        treatment plan to maximize your body’s ability to reduce or eliminate
        symptoms. This may involve a combination of in-clinic sessions and
        techniques prescribed for you to work on at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Treatments may include maneuvers to correct vertigo, techniques to help
        reduce or eliminate symptoms and improve focus while moving, balance
        training, hands-on treatments, diet, lifestyle and at-home exercises.
      </p>

      <p>
        At your initial appointment the therapist will discuss any medical
        history that relates to your condition, so please bring details of any
        health problems and past treatments. Our therapists will perform a
        thorough assessment to determine causes and contributing factors to your
        condition. Assessment findings and how the vestibular system works will
        be explained and a treatment plan will be recommended, if indicated.
        Your therapist will also explain when you can expect to see results.

Pelvic Floor Physiotherapy
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    <div class="pelvic-floor-rehab">
      <h1>Pelvic Floor Physiotherapy</h1>
      <p>
        Pelvic floor physiotherapy help women rehabilitate their pelvic floor
        muscles. These muscles can be weakened by childbirth, surgery, heavy
        lifting, being overweight, constipation or menopause. The pelvic floor
        muscles support the womb (uterus), bladder and bowel (colon), forming a
        'sling' from the pubic bone at the front to the tailbone at the back. If
        the muscles are weak, this can affect bladder and bowel control,
        resulting in incontinence (leakage) or prolapse.
      </p>
      <p>
        For other women, their pelvic floor muscles may be overactive; that is,
        they can switch on involuntarily when they should be relaxing. These
        women need to learn to release their muscles. Overactivity can cause
        difficulty with having sex, emptying the bladder or bowels or using
        tampons.
      </p>
      <p>
        This could include exercises, biofeedback (electronic monitoring), and
        manual treatment of the muscles. Advice about daily activities and
        fitness, as well as good bladder and bowel habits, will be given.
        Functional training of the pelvic floor gets your muscles back working
        effectively when you need them.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is good evidence that shows that pelvic floor physiotherapy can
        help with urinary incontinence and prolapse and can lessen the effects
        of childbirth and menopause on the pelvic floor, says Jean Hailes pelvic
        floor physiotherapist Janetta Webb. A pelvic floor physiotherapist is an
        important part of the multi-disciplinary team managing bladder and bowel
        health, sexual difficulties and pelvic pain. Women should not have to
        put up with incontinence, pelvic pain or discomfort.
